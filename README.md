# Deep Learning Final Project: Text Classification Using Simple RNN

## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify text data based on its originâ€”whether it comes from Spanish or English literature and news sources. The model employs tokenization for pre-processing and a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifier to perform the classification task.

The project aims to demonstrate how deep learning models can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically in text classification. It focuses on building a robust text classifier capable of distinguishing between English and Spanish text, which has applications in language processing, content categorization, and multilingual NLP systems.

## Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and sequence padding for input data.
- **Simple RNN Model**: A Recurrent Neural Network architecture for text classification.
- **Language Classification**: Distinguishes between English and Spanish text.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
